The scripts directory holds all the scripts that were used in making the sea ice chart
Stage of Development (SOD) based Antarctic Sea Ice Thickness (SIT) dataset.

All scripts for this project were written in the MATLAB programming language. 

Data used to create the SIT product are: 
	1. Antarctic sea ice chart shapefiles from the National Ice Center (NIC)
	    - 2002-present --> download from the NIC website https://usicecenter.gov/Products/AntarcData
	    - 1998-2001    --> available upon request from NIC in .e00 format and must be converted to .shp (see NIC-Ice-Chart-Prep repo)

	2. Antarctic Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) 
	    - from Bremen Institute of Environmental Physics for 2002-present on a 3.125 km grid https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/data-archive/
	    - from NSIDC before 2002 https://nsidc.org/home 




Note there are many scripts here that were used for testing and/or plotting only.
